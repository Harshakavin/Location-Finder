# Location-Finder
This mobile application is developed to address very important issues that are found currently. Even though the world is developing at a rapid phase, some issues are not addressed properly. Today all the day today activities are connected with the mobile phone; there are numerous apps that serve different purposes. But finding that one app which provides maximum benefits is difficult. We used to make a call or text if we are to find a location of a person but now it has changed. We can use GPS if we want to know the location. But still it is a question if the location is very accurate.
